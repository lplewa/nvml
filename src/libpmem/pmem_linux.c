/*
 * is_pmem_proc -- use /proc to implement pmem_is_pmem()
 *
 * This function returns true only if the entire range can be confirmed
 * as being direct access persistent memory.  Finding any part of the
 * range is not direct access, or failing to look up the information
 * because it is unmapped or because any sort of error happens, just
 * results in returning false.
 *
 * This function works by lookup up the range in /proc/self/smaps and
 * verifying the "mixed map" vmflag is set for that range.  While this
 * isn't exactly the same as direct access, there is no DAX flag in
 * the vmflags d the mixed map flag is only true on regular files when
 * DAX is in-use, so it serves the purpose.
 *
 * The range passed in may overlap with multiple entries in the smaps list
 * so this function loops through the smaps entries until the entire range
 * is verified as direct access, or until it is clear the answer is false
 * in which case it stops the loop and returns immediately.
 *
 * NOTE: There is an implementation of workaround for an issue with reading
 * from /proc/self/smaps while other thread is modifying process mappings.
 * It may happen that some mapping can be not visible in /proc/self/smaps
 * even if the mapping exists. The workaround rereads the /proc/self/smaps
 * file if a given memory range (or part of it) is not visible but the
 * mapping exists according to mincore(2).
